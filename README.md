**Step 1: Story**

This is a very useful yet easy to make project. This will determine the
water level in a container and prevents the overflow of water. This
device needs minimal maintenance. This device sends an alert to let you
know water is too high or too low.

Normally, regulating water levels can consume electricity and
wastewater. However, with automatic controllers, the electricity usage
is limited as well as less water needed to regulate supply. It helps in
saving money by limiting the waste of water and electricity.

> We call it Water Level Indicator.

> I've paid just 2 Dollars to get my PCB after five days only, what I

**Step 4:**

Stick the PCB in custom designed box with the help of glue gun and also
stick a 12 volt socket for power supply.
