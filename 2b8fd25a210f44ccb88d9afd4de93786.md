**Step 1: Story**

This is a very useful yet easy to make project. This will determine the
water level in a container and prevents the over�ow of water. This
device needs minimal maintenance. This device sends an alert to let you
know water is too high or too low.

Normally, regulating water levels can consume electricity and
wastewater. However, with automatic controllers, the electricity usage
is limited as well as less water needed to regulate supply. It helps in
saving money by limiting the waste of water and electricity.
